# prettify_visualizations

## Who am I?

My name is Berkay Canogullari. I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Data Science at the University of San Francisco, which I will be graduating in mid-August. At the same time, I'm working as a Machine Learning Researcher at the University of California, San Francisco.


## About the project

Purpose of this project is to re-design some visualisations on the internet using the techniques and ideas I learned in my EDA class. Changes made can be found in the report and codes to create updated visualisations can be found in the jupyter notebooks.
